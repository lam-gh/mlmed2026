    "\n",
    "We draw the segment mask on the ultrasound image using some deep learning model, then we estimate an ellipse on the mask using opencv, and finally we calculate the head circumference by finding the circumference of the estimated ellipse and the given pixel size. \n",

    "\n",
    "We will use PyTorch, use the data in the `training_set` as the input, where the original ultrasound image is the input, and the annotated binary mask is the output of the model. \n",
