\section{Data}

This is a toy deep learning model trained on the PhysionNet’s MIT-BIH dataset to
classify heartbeats. 

\section{Model}

The model used in this report has a basic convolutional architecture.
The model is composed of three conv1d layers. Each have 32 kernels of size 5
with ReLU activation.
Following the convolutional layers are a max pooling layer of size 5, strides 2.
Then a flatten layer. Two fully connected layers with relu, then softmax, respectively.

\section{Training}

For training, we use the categorical cross entropy as loss function, Adam optimizer, and metrics is accuracy. 

Then we train with batch size 64, and 12 epochs.

\section{Result}

The result is 9.9785 on test loss, and 0.8276 on test accuracy.
